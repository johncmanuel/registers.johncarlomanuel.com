"And here are the boxes for the kitchen!"

My girlfriend elegantly stepped down from the back of the moving truck onto the stone pavement. Her fluffy, curly brown hair ending at chin-length and brown eyes never stopped capturing my attention even after a few years together. Her pink turtleneck cardigan with a white, long-sleeved shirt underneath, her pure black skirt, and her white tights with a black flowery pattern suit her perfectly.

After inhaling the early morning air, she lowered her eyes a little and smiled at me.

"What are you looking at?"

"Ahehehe… just admiring you."

She takes a few steps toward me.

"Well, you can admire me later by bringing these boxes to the kitchen."

"Yeah yeah I know! Can't I admire you just for a, uhm, few seconds?"

"You can do that later, okay?"

She gestured towards the boxes.

"If you bring these boxes," she kept her smile. "I will be sure to give you a reward."

I grinned like a child who saw their favorite food on the dinner table.

"Woo! Now we're talking!" I threw my hands in the air.

She giggled quietly to herself and went back into the moving truck to get more boxes.

Sometime later, my girlfriend finished unloading the rest of the boxes from the truck. She was sitting on the pavement, taking a quick rest from the physical labor.

"So so so so!" I exclaimed. "Reward! Gimme!"

She giggled and blushed. "You're so childish."

She stood up from the pavement, walked up to me, and wrapped her arms around my neck. Then, she pecked my lips a few times, ending it off with a long smooch.

"Are you fine with me being sweaty and all?" she asked me

"Yeah, I don't mind… I mean, I'm kinda sweaty too."

She wrapped her arms around my waist and rested her head on my chest.

"You know very well how much I love you, don't you?" she whispered. "I'm always thinking about you, no matter where I am."

"Of course I do," I whispered back. "We've been together for a long time— wait, why're you even asking?"

"I'm just reminding you, is all," she looked up at me. "We promised to open up to each other and not hold any secrets with each other."

I laid my hands on her cheeks and kissed her forehead.

"I'll never break that promise, ever. And I'll never hold any secrets too."

She closed her eyes and rested her head again on my chest.

"Yes, I know that very well."

I laughed a little. "I think we should move the rest of the boxes now, don't ya think?"

She gasped and stared at me in shock.

"Can you bring my belongings into our room? Thank you very much!"

I picked up one of her boxes and made my way into the house.

The house interior wasn't all that fancy or anything. It was just your typical suburban American home in 2023 with a very modern look. Since we're living in a time where technology is really good, the whole place is stocked with smart devices like smart lights, and smart home hubs; basically, everything in the home has advanced technology. My girlfriend wanted these features so we wouldn't stress out about managing the house. We're both very productive people, and we want to be efficient with our time.

I went upstairs and opened the door to our room. It has, again, a typical modern look. Our master bedroom was larger than I remembered the last time my girlfriend and I visited. I laid the first of her boxes down.

After bringing in about a dozen of her belongings, I went back outside to get the last one. This one was… kinda heavy.

I struggled and struggled, enduring a short, painful journey to our master bedroom, and quickly laid down the last box. I took a few breathers and sat down on the white floor.

But something was oddly off about that heavy box, and that made me awfully curious about it. Before doing anything else, I stood up and went outside to grab a knife made for opening these boxes. Holding the knife in my hand, I went back into the room and closed the door. I walked over to the mysterious box with a stronger sense of curiosity than before.

My instincts told me to cut it now. And that was what I did.

Slowly cutting the top, I opened the box a little. More cuts later, I opened the box entirely.

"Holy shit." My mouth opened at the sight of the strangest, unexpected contents that my girlfriend bundled into a moving box.

It was a collection of guns and axes. A few small hatchets, a couple of handguns, and ammunition boxes for the guns were all neatly packed and perfectly fitted. A couple of the hatchets had a red splatter on them. These weren't props— these were real.

What the fuck?

She never told me about this. She never brought up any of this to me. In my few years of dating her, she never mentioned anything about keeping weapons at home. We even promised each other we would never hold secrets!

Am I dating a fucking serial killer? All this time? No no no, it's too early to jump to conclusions… shit, what am I doing?

I quickly closed the box and hid it away in the closet. I shut the closet doors and took a deep breath.

There's no way she'll come in right now… right?

"Is something the matter?" a high-pitched, familiar voice echoed.

My girlfriend, leaning on the doorway with her hands behind her back, looked really concerned.

My heart was beating rapidly— it was way too fast for me to handle. Sweat started taking over the rest of my skin in response to her sudden entrance. I knew I couldn't lie to her about the box, but I have to hide what I just found. I don't even think I should confront her about it later.

"Uhm i-it was nothing! I-I, uhm, was just taking a break!"

"Oh, is that so?"

At this rate, I don't think my heart rate would go down.

"Y-Yes! Yes that's right!"

She stepped into our room, shooting glances all around her. After noticing the boxes I brought into our room, she smiled softly and turned to me.

"Thank you for bringing my belongings in."

"O-Of course! I'll do anything for you!"

She giggled.

We both waited for each other to fill the awkward silence between us. I prayed she would leave the room so I would be able to quickly tape back the box I just opened. If she opened the closet behind me, it would be over for me. I would probably never see the outside world again.

She tilted her head a little. "Are you sure you're okay? You don't seem well."

"Y-Yes! I'm okay!"

She took a few steps towards me. Her face was extremely concerned.

"Are you… hiding something from me?"

Shit shit shit shit shit. This is not good, not not not good. The hell do I do? What do I do?!

"Hiding something? N-No, I wouldn't!"

She scowled at me and crossed her arms. "You know, I really don't like it when you lie to me."

Damn it, we've been together long enough for her to easily detect bullshit.

"I'm not lying!"

"Then tell me what it is that you're hiding, \_right now\_."

"Okay fine, I was going through one of the boxes because—"

She glared at me. Her reaction was already enough said.

"Alright fine—Yuna why the hell are you carrying guns and axes? I was seriously carrying a whole ass fucking armory in one of your boxes!"

"\_What? What\_ are you talking about?"

"You know what I'm talking about Yuna! Don't lie to me!"

Yuna looked really bewildered. "I… I don't know how to respond to that. You're not making any sense whatsoever!"

"Fine, I'll show you what I mean!"

I opened the closet doors to look for that particular box. I went inside and returned with the box of her hidden weapons.

"Now, explain this."

Her face had guilt written all over her face. All she could do was stare at the box as if something was calling her.

"Yuna if you don't answer me, I'm calling the fucking cops!"

She was shaken after hearing that. "I… There is a reason why I have those with me…"

Yuna didn't make any eye contact with me after saying that.

"I… I need those weapons… to protect us."

I was confused. "Protect us? From what?"

"..."

I was even more confused.

She hesitated, "I need those weapons to protect us. I just want us to be safe."

"Look, Yuna, I don't know what you're thinking, but we just moved to one of the safest neighborhoods in the country."

"I… I only want us to be safe. I must protect us…"

"Safe from what? Tell me Yuna! I'm so goddamn confused!"

"..."

"_Yuna!_"

She shook again. Watching her scared like that made me realize I went a bit too far. Yuna seemed really genuine in what she said, but I'm still so confused. Who's out there to kill us?

"Yuna, you know we were supposed to be open with each other, right?"

"I know…" she sniffed a few times. "I'm sorry. Please… please forgive me… I didn't want to scare you. That's why I kept it a secret."

Yuna cried to herself. I was pretty pissed, and I don't think I would forgive her for a while.

"I, I need some time to think this over. Let's just get the rest of the things outside."

She glanced up at me for a couple of seconds, nodded, and looked away. I never liked seeing her sad, but I did what was necessary.

\*﻿\*\*

"It’s only 12 AM?”

I put down my phone and closed my eyes again.

I was laying down on the bed in the room with Yuna next to me, facing away from me. She was sound asleep. We took the entire day to finish unpacking the rest of our things and setting everything up in the house. Sometimes she acted weirdly by checking the backyard and the nearby homes with a serious face as if she completely forgot about what happened this morning. There were still a lot of things to fix in the house, but we decided to do it once we woke up.

While trying to clear my thoughts from earlier this morning, I heard Yuna bringing herself closer to me. It sounded like she slowly moving on all fours. The bed creaked louder and louder until I sensed her presence overlooking mine. She was very close—to the point where I felt her breath.

She—no, this thing—was like this for a while. I wanted to wake up and run away from her as far as possible, but my body was not the type to listen in moments like this. I felt her strange aura piercing the walls of my soul, searching for something deeply buried within. The longer she continued this, the more this, heavy feeling, continued to grow within the depths of my stomach.

I found it harder to breathe and gasp for air. Sweat emerged from every inch of my body, telling me that danger was here. Cold shivers ran down my spine, my neck felt something creeping up from within, my muscles tensed, and my awareness peaked.

Everything sounded louder to the point where my heartbeat was easy to hear. The second hand of the clock hung on the wall ticked, ticked, and ticked. What felt like seconds felt like minutes, and what felt like minutes felt like hours. Time was nonexistent, and I couldn't tell just how long she was in that position.

Curiosity kicked in, begging me to open my eyes and see what was hovering over me. But I knew that would only make this situation worse. Every time I told myself not to open my eyes, the more I wanted to.

I could only stay in this position and wait in constant fear.

"You know very well how much I love you, don't you?" she whispered. "I'm always thinking about you, no matter where I am."

I heard the same, high-pitched voice that I yearned to listen to since the beginning of our relationship. But something felt off. She said it slowly, and deliberately. It felt more menacing and more ominous; it felt as if it emerged from the deepest parts of another world.

My body began trembling. I couldn't stop it at all. But instinctively, I gradually opened my eyes and looked up.

It was Yuna, but with a face of malicious intent and her glowing, yellow eyes. She started giggling.

My body froze in a state of fear. I kept telling my body to run, but nothing happened. My voice was gone, and I couldn't say anything at all.

Her right hand hovered over my heart.

I screamed in agony as a flow of green light exited my chest.

Her eyes widened. "Shhh… it's time to go to sleep."

"GET AWAY FROM HIM!" the same voice as the being above me yelled.

At the doorway into our room, Yuna, with a pistol and a hatchet in her hands, appeared. The Yuna with yellow eyes stood up and turned around in a snap. The one at the doorway carefully aimed her pistol.

\_Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\_

The Yuna with yellow eyes was knocked off the bed and down on the ground, rolling a bit until she hit a wall.

She glared at her. Most of her body was covered in gunshot wounds.

The brown-eyed Yuna raised her hatchet and landed its sharp, curved edge on her head. She kept doing it until she—or it—stopped moving. Its head was sliced open, exposing the internal flesh.

She dropped her weapons and immediately knelt down next to me, where our faces are at the same level. Yuna placed her hands on the sides of my head and then touched my forehead with hers.

"Y-Yuna… but, but…" I finally spoke after what felt like a long time.

"Forgive me for not being there in time…" she whispered to me while on the verge of tears. "I… I should have known sooner before they attacked…"

"Yuna…"
