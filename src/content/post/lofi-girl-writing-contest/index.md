Didn't make it to the top 10, but this was an excellent way to brush up on my creative writing. It was also really fun to write, given the theme of the contest :)

## Story

“I’ll have a cup of black coffee please!”

Lofi Girl, with a cup of coffee in her hand, sat over at her study table in the back corner of the coffee
shop. It was a slow, early Saturday morning, so it wasn’t busy with people just yet. On her desk was
her laptop, headphones, a pencil, and a notebook. Below the desk was her backpack. Once she
settled in, she put on her headphones, turned on the music, and started her next study session.

Lofi Girl normally studies at home, but a change of environment helps a lot with productivity.

After a few study sessions, she packed her belongings in her backpack and began walking out.

But it was at this moment in time, she experienced something unforgettable in her life.

A group of people, professional cameras in hand, aimed at Lofi Girl. With each second came a flurry
of flashes and rapid clicks from the cameras, all accompanied by yells loud enough to attract
everyone within the vicinity.

“Lofi Girl! Lofi Girl! Could you tell us more about your journey as a student? Could you also tell us
about your study livestreams?”

“How does it feel to be the mascot of the Lo-Fi study spaces?”

“Ma’am! Ma’am! Would you ever collaborate with Lofi Boy?”

Their aggressive pursuit of Lofi Girl combined with the sudden spot on the center of public attention
put her into a state of panic. She shielded herself from the cameras and the people and swiftly
began walking away. All she could ever think about was getting away from them. Away and away.

Eventually what turned out to be a small group became a large crowd of them, all pursuing Lofi Girl
for her attention.

She began running, and running, and running. As far away as she can from the crowd as they chase
her like a predator going for their prey.

Lofi Girl was nearly out of breath and made it to a nearby subway station in hopes that the train
would carry her out of this chaotic situation. She darted her eyes back and forth between the
incoming train and the station entrance until the train came, stopped, and opened its doors. There
were barely any passengers.

Before she entered, she turned around.

“Lofi Girl wait!”

“Lofi Girl we just want a quick answer! Please!”

“LOFI GIRL!!!”

There was no stop to them. The crowd began converting everyone around them, where they also
want Lofi Girl’s attention.

“Quick, over here!” shouted the boy with a purple beanie who was offering his hand.

She grabbed his hand. He pulled her inside the train before the doors closed on the crowd behind
her. The passengers inside the train were more than confused by the crowd’s appearance.

“You alright?”

Lofi Girl catches her breath.

“Yeah, thanks.”

She wondered to herself who the boy was. He did look oddly familiar, though.

The boy kept his head down, facing away from the rest of the passengers. She wanted to ask him something but behind them, a couple of passengers were talking about a
certain individual.

“Woah woah woah! Lofi Boy’s in town?!”

“Whaaaat? Are you sure it’s him?”

“Yes obviously! Apparently he was last seen by the coffee shop!”

“Ooooh! Hopefully we’ll see him! I like his live study sessions! The ones with the synthwaves
music!”

They continued on and on about him.

“Lofi Boy…” Lofi Girl thought to herself.

Once the train came to a stop, Lofi Girl and the boy walked out of it together.

The subway station was quiet compared to the last one. She had no idea where in Lyon she was.

Maybe somewhere located on the outskirts? Maybe somewhere outside of the city? She didn’t
remember where the train headed.

But Lofi Girl sighed with relief. At least they weren’t there!

Until one of the people waiting for the train pointed at them.

“LOOOOFIIII GIIIIRL! LOOOOFIIII BOOOOY!”

Everyone turned their heads towards Lofi Girl and the boy. They all began taking out their phones to
record them.

“Oh my god oh my god! I love your study sessions!”

“Can we get a pic together real quick?”

“Hey hey get out of the way! I want a pic too!”

“Are y’all dating?! No way!”

“Lofi Boy?!” Lofi Girl shouted in her head.

The boy grabbed her arm and started sprinting towards the exit.

“I know a place we can head to! One of my friends owns it! C’mon!”

“Uh okay!”

Together, they both ran as fast as their feet could take them as their fans ran after them with phones
and cameras in their hands. The news of them spotted together brought a good chunk of the city on
their tail. They were met with large crowds at every corner of the city. Their fans were screaming
their names, praising them for the live study sessions they both conducted. Most, if not all of them
only wanted a picture with the two of them.

Lofi Girl and the boy ran and ran and ran across the city.

They ran until they went to the place the boy mentioned. They both stopped to catch their breath.

It was a cafe, almost identical to the one she was at earlier. There was a sign on the door that said:
“CLOSED”.

After catching their breath, he opened the door, entering the shop with Lofi Girl behind him. They
both sat down at a table far away from the entrance.

“Forgot to introduce myself,” he said. “I’m Lofi Boy. We should stay low for the time being.”
