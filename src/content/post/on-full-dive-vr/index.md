I remember watching this anime, [“Sword Art Online”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online), a long time ago in middle school (when I first became hooked on the anime genre). It was pretty popular with the people I talked to at that time, alongside other anime shows like Attack on Titan or Fairy Tail. Every day at lunch, I would regularly talk about it with my friends and share our thoughts on it.

What attracted my attention to Sword Art Online in the first place was the [NerveGear](https://swordartonline.fandom.com/wiki/NerveGear), a virtual reality headgear that enables the user to access the virtual world through its microwave transceivers (they’re capable of killing a person, if the microwave signals are strong enough to hit the person’s brain) and various other pieces of hardware. The principal feature of the NerveGear is clearly its functionality to send the user to the virtual world (in the case of the anime, it sends the user to Aincrad, the main setting for the story). This is basically the gateway to achieving full-dive VR. When activating the NerveGear, all you need to do is shout [“Link, Start!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t8jLB_kKoA). Simple as that! As far as I know, I’m not sure if any original source materials dive (haha) deep into the technicalities behind the hardware design—at least down to the logic gate level. It would be a fun project, with the right expertise and skill set, to replicate something of this caliber. The NerveGear is quite a cool hardware concept, I won’t lie!

When inside the virtual world, that’s when the user would feel a shock of awe. The world is powered by specialized software that controls the environment that affects the user’s senses. For instance, when the world shows the wind it plays a sound that the user can hear. The wind would howl at the user, and the user could feel the breeze. The user would most likely shiver and/or feel goosebumps. The user can also use their arms, which are basically made of lines of code, to touch the grass beneath them. Pretty much, the user can make use of their senses as if they were in physical reality—you get the idea. Meanwhile, the user outside the virtual world would not be able to utilize their senses to interact with the physical world because the hardware and software are explicitly designed to do that in order for the immersion to stay intact. It wouldn’t be fun if your friend or family member calls you to go raid with them in Final Fantasy XIV while you’re trying to explore procedurally generated natural terrain filled with mountains, hills, rivers, and various other geographical elements! Regardless, the fact that this is done all through the manipulation of mere bits at the logic gate level is something worth appreciating deeply. This is what full-dive VR is capable of doing.

Few people, especially non-gamers and non-anime fans, do not favor the concept due to the dystopian vibes it emits through media representation (i.e [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One), [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash)). Escapism would become far more common, and the world would start adapting to the virtual world, perhaps even abandoning the physical world, just so no one falls behind in technology. However, I would like to claim that full-dive VR—not the state of VR right now—is capable of providing great value to society mainly because full-dive VR can help people’s creativity flourish, assist in helping with research, and advance today’s games (provided we have the necessary hardware, of course).

## Creativity

Presently, a wide variety of software, either proprietary or open-source, for helping people express their artistic talents is widely available to anyone with a decent computer and Internet access. Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Krika, Unity, and even Google Docs (which I am currently writing on right now!) are all examples of software capable of producing artistic works (and yes, video games are art forms, I would like to write about that one day). I’ll call these pieces of software: creative software. The definition? Software that is designed for users to leverage their creativity to create meaningful works. Creative software is—what I believe—revolutionary for the creative world. They allow us to quickly turn our ideas into reality with only a computer (and possibly a few electronic accessories, depending on the type of creative work). It can be safe to assume that it is much easier today to access these tools online and get started on projects than in the past, all with the help of the Internet!

Creative software is also being developed in the VR field. [Google’s Tilt Brush](https://www.tiltbrush.com/) is an open-source game where people can use brushes and other special tools in a 3D, VR environment to paint illustrations. Some video games like [ScupltrVR](https://www.sculptrvr.com/) and [Flying Things VR](https://giantlazer.com/flying-things-vr-game/) are also designed to leverage creativity for the players. Speaking of games, Unity and Unreal game engines allow developers to create VR games for the few, popular VR headsets we have today ([Valve’s Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex), [Meta’s Oculus Quest 2](https://store.facebook.com/quest/products/quest-2/), and [PlayStation’s VR headset](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-vr/)). Arguably, sandbox games—video games with the sole purpose of giving the player the creative freedom to do what they want while relieving them of any game objectives— using VR integration can be considered creative software. [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/vr) and [Dreams (PS4 Game)](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dreams/) are good examples of that.

You might be wondering how full-dive VR fits into the current topic of creative software and creativity. Because full-dive VR allows people the opportunity to immerse themselves completely into the virtual world, it opens up a ton of opportunities for people to express themselves.

One way would be through software development kits (SDKs) for programming tools for the virtual world. Programmers would be able to make use of the SDK to create tools that empower creativity in a certain, artistic field. One example would be software that specializes in environment manipulation, where the artist can design an entirely new virtual world that has a particular theme and personality to it. The artist can pull down the menu with their virtual hand and use the software created with an SDK to begin building their ideal, virtual world. By virtual worlds, I mean they can range from small towns to large planets. For example, someone may create a world containing a city set in the 1920s United States, a cyberpunk world set 100 years in the future, or a peaceful town set in classical times. To further the immersion, designers would be able to implement features that make use of our senses. They can add in smells that can help the players know what kind of place they are entering. Maybe the smell of fresh air? Trash cans? Or possibly add in ambient noises to make use of our sound senses for liveliness? Or maybe throw in NPCs in the mix? The point is that designers can literally build anything they want. The only limit is their imagination.

![An example of a virtual world](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/Images/BuildingWorlds/worlds_topic.png "An example of a virtual world (Source: Unreal Engine)")

Another way full-dive VR would empower creativity is by making use of the environment in a way that encourages the player to generate ideas quickly. In the physical world, some people may refer to this as a “creative corner” or some other related name. Whenever I want to become more creative, I would surround myself with the type of art I want to be able to produce. If I wanted to write a book, I would clear my workplace and fill it with books to ensure my brain can only think of books—nothing else. Combined with a word processor on my computer that enables me to hide all of its features except for the pages, (and set the display on dark mode!) I’ll be able to maximize my writing productivity and publish material faster.

By using full-dive VR, I can replicate that same environment, but even better. I can build a small coffee shop with lo-fi music playing in the background and start writing out my thoughts on a virtual computer with the same writing software setup ASAP! Maybe even allow other players immersed in full-dive VR to join your world and work on similar projects. This would allow others to not only enjoy interacting with fellow human beings but to bounce possible ideas off of each other, leading to the creation of even more unique ideas that no one has thought of yet. You may be able to imagine research being done on people’s productivity when working in an environment that suits them perfectly: it would be off the charts! More and more creative works would be published onto the online world for everyone to see (if they set the privacy setting to the public), and thus people’s creativity would flourish. We’ll be able to gauge just how creative humans really are. Ultimately, working in an environment best suited to the player’s needs in full-dive VR would definitely boost anyone’s creativity in any given field. Rather than relying on these psychological tricks in the physical world, why not make use of full-dive VR to build your own perfect creative environment?

## Research

Full-dive VR can not only be used as a creative tool, but as a research tool for answering the questions we are deeply curious about. It can be fun to let our curiosity drive our motivations for doing research and presenting our results to the world; however, research cannot be fun when the methodology for our experiment does not meet our expectations. For instance, when a person is doing research that requires a ton of hardware preparations for the experiment, the hardware could malfunction, ruining the experiment before it can be started. Essentially, the preparation stages of an experiment could go wrong, resulting in increased financial and equipment expenses. That’s not fun, isn’t it?

The solution to this issue is computer simulations. More specifically, within the virtual worlds. In the physical realm, there has been quite a heavy use of simulations to test a hypothesis. [In my research at nEXO,](https://www.johncarlomanuel.com/post/research-in-nexo/) I had to program a simulator that produces biased data (because I’m technically in control of the parameters that produce said data) to analyze the systematic error in an experiment. Simulations help speed up research time, ensuring that more time is dedicated to thinking about the results. These useful necessities can also help researchers reduce the overall cost of the experiments that will be conducted.

So the big question stands: what if full-dive VR can be used in place of standard computers to create simulations for research? The first thought that may come to mind is: couldn’t ordinary computer simulations be used instead? Simulations in full-dive VR would be able to leverage an important, vital aspect: interaction. Interacting with the simulations would open up more variables to account for in research and thus lead to more interesting results.

Full-dive VR can help with simulating hazardous environments so that we human beings can safely explore them without the risk of death. The first type of environment that comes into mind is caverns— the ones located far deep into Earth. When deep into these caverns, the temperature of the environment would become quite hot, making the journey to the center of the Earth impossible! As far as I know, we may not know what the caverns near the Earth’s core are exactly like; however, the materials that make up this particular biome are relatively well-known. Using this information, designers can lay out a hypothesized version of the caverns, taking into account the variables that are necessary for the research and simulating the environment as close to reality as possible. After that, researchers can explore the caverns for themselves and collect data. This process can also apply to other dangerous environments like the deep ocean floor or outer space. Perhaps the richest source of data in this context is the psychological reactions of humans entering these unknown environments.

Full-dive VR can also simulate lifeforms that are currently alive, went extinct, or only exist as a concept. It’s always shocking for me to always hear that a certain species went extinct, never to be seen again. However, given the knowledge and research we know regarding these creatures, it is possible to “revive” them again in the virtual world and study them once more. It is possible to also do this for creatures that are alive; though, I don’t see the point in doing so when one can visit them for themselves. For ones that only exist as a concept (whether it’s in fiction or other speculative material), simulations can be used to hypothesize and test their behavior towards other creatures.

Last thing to note: researchers need to note in their papers or presentations that they have used full-dive VR to carry out their research. Full-dive VR has the potential to become a powerful research tool, no doubt about that; though, as it is used for simulations, it can lead to malicious results intended to always be in favor of the researchers themselves, not society.

## Games

When VR first reached the masses, it was originally catered to high-end gamers with beefy computers, as seen with Valve’s 2016 HTC Vive and Oculus VR’s 2016 Oculus Rift. Many of the applications that came with the head-mounted displays are practically video games. While the hardware behind it is impressive, the games (at the time) could use some work in the long term.

Many of the games released in the VR market are mainly arcade games that are optimized for short, intense sessions of pure fun. Games like [Space Pirate Trainer](https://www.spacepiratetrainer.com/) or [Superhot VR](https://superhotgame.com/superhot-vr) are good examples of this. They are well-made games; I had tons of fun playing them on my 2016 HTC Vive, so I cannot say they are garbage. The thing about these games is that they get boring quickly. In Space Pirate Trainer, after a couple of hours of replaying the same mechanics, it gets pretty dull. However, arcade games are awesome, don’t get me wrong about that, but I think games made for fun in the long-term are a lot better for the VR market because they help the general audience stay engaged longer. Generally, I think this is true for video games in general. In full-dive VR, this would solve the problem and even push the boundaries for good game designs and ultimately contribute value to society.

![Picture of a player punching an enemy ](https://www.roadtovr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/superhot-vr-review-8.jpg "Screenshot of Superhot VR (Source: Road to VR)")

A possible solution is to develop long, story-driven games with a strong emphasis on strong narratives and game mechanics so that the audience would stay hooked for hours. Most story-driven games impact the players the most over other kinds of games since they teach us the usual cliche, but extremely important lessons we tend to overlook throughout our lives. [Katawa Shoujo, a well-known bishōjo-styled visual novel](https://www.katawa-shoujo.com/), not only does a good job handling disability, it invokes emotions never felt before in players, leading them to learn more about themselves so they can become better human beings. Endwalker—the fourth expansion of [the critically acclaimed MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/)—dives deep into the theme of existentialism and helps players realize that life is worth living for, even when facing despair itself.

In full-dive VR, the same game design principles for narrative games can be applied here, and they can be easily extended too. For instance, video games build immersion mainly through audio and visuals. Because full-dive VR makes use of all five senses, video games in the virtual world can utilize them as well. Imagine being able to have dinner with NPCs while chatting with them or fighting a monster with a sword in one hand and a fire spell in another! They can be done in normal VR, but actual feedback from these events happens is received by the player’s body, simulating the same feelings as if we are to do this in real life. This would elevate future games in the virtual world and possibly take over the competition in the video game market, forcing everyone, including the top gaming giants and indie game developers, to adapt to this new norm. It would cause a surge in competition, allowing for more job openings in game studios to push for the newly-made full-dive VR market and make history.

Full-dive VR can also make games more fun in the long term by introducing new forms of game mechanics. Recall earlier that full-dive VR makes use of all five senses. The ability to move freely in the virtual world without constraints would require lots of innovative thinking for developing better game designs. While I cannot think of any good ones to discuss at the moment, I’ll leave this as a brainstorming exercise for the reader. New game mechanics would lead to more creative video games being released out there. It’ll be exciting for most of society to see how creative the human mind can be when offered new tools to work with.

An important point to mention: in the physical world, no one would want to stand for hours listening to dialogue and fighting enemies with simple strokes of the controller. The player can simply sit down if they feel like it, or implement good game design for VR games by setting up automated reminders throughout the game to let the player know they have to sit down and take a break. That shows how much the developers care for their player base. Those same principles can be applied to full-dive VR games by reminding the players to disconnect from the virtual world for a few hours and come back later to play again.

## Summary

Full-dive VR can contribute tons of value to society by shaping the way games are formed, research is conducted, and creativity is used. Coming up with new game mechanics and emphasizing narrative games help with long-term success in the full-dive VR market. Research progress increases significantly with computer simulations, specifically for extinct lifeforms and dangerous environments. Creativity prospers through the manipulation of game environments to fit the players’ preferences and the use of software development kits to make creative software for artists and designers.
